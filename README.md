# 🌸 Mysty AI

Mysty is a locally hosted Discord + Web AI assistant built for speed, sarcasm, and customizability.  
It runs on your machine but can be shared securely with friends using tunneling services.

## ✨ Features

- 🎤 Voice-controlled AI assistant  
- 🤖 Discord bot integration  
- 💾 Persistent memory with SQLite  
- 🎙️ TTS output (local, not in VC)  
- 🎨 Sarcastic + witty personality (no generic fallback replies)  
- 🚀 Lightweight + fast response times  
- 🔒 Private hosting with ngrok (share with friends without exposing your IP)  

---

## 🚀 Deployment

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Mysty is designed to run **locally on your own hardware**.  
> Cloud hosting is not recommended due to GPU/latency requirements.

### 🔹 Running Locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUser/Mysty.git
cd Mysty
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
🔹 Sharing Access (Ngrok)
Run ngrok to create a temporary secure link:

bash
Copy code
ngrok http 5000
This generates a unique URL (refreshes daily) you can share with trusted users.
Supports up to 5 concurrent users on mid-range GPUs without noticeable slowdown.

⚙️ Performance Notes
[!TIP]
If you have a GPU like the RTX 4060, you can force Mysty to run 100% on GPU for faster response times.
For lighter loads (1–3 users), a balanced CPU/GPU split is fine.

Expected latency with 3–5 users:

⏱️ ~1.2s per response (GPU mode)

⏱️ ~2–2.5s per response (CPU-balanced mode)

🛠️ Configuration
Memory → Stored in data/memory.sqlite

Commands → Organized under mystymanager/ (admin + text commands)

Events → In mystymanager/events/

You can customize Mysty’s personality, voice settings, and bot behavior inside config.py.

🌐 Deployment Alternatives
If you don’t want to host locally, you can explore:

🔹 Render (web app hosting)

🔹 Koyeb (cloud container hosting)

🔹 GitHub Codespaces (browser-hosted dev environment)

[!WARNING]
Free hosts like Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, or GitHub Pages will not work since Mysty requires a Python backend and GPU access.

🖥️ GitHub Codespaces (Optional)
[!NOTE]
If you set the port below 1023, you must run sudo PORT=1023

Create a GitHub account if you haven’t already.

Click Code → Create Codespace on main.

Run:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
Forward the port in Codespaces and set it to public visibility.
